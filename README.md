# Phishing Detection

This repository contains tools and models for detecting phishing URLs using machine learning.

## Files in This Repository

- `FeatureExtractor.py`: Contains functions for extracting features from URLs.
- `ModelHandler.py`: Manages the training and evaluation of the machine learning models.
- `detection-malicious-url-using-ml-models.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the process of detecting malicious URLs using ML models.
- `phishing.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt` for details)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Over-Mind1/phishing_s_detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd phishing_s_detection
    ```

3. Install the necessary Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

- Run `FeatureExtractor.py` to process and extract features from URLs.
- Use `ModelHandler.py` to train or evaluate the machine learning models.
- Open `detection-malicious-url-using-ml-models.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to view examples and visualize the results.

## Dataset

- `phishing.csv` contains the data used for model training and evaluation. Ensure this file is present in the project directory.
